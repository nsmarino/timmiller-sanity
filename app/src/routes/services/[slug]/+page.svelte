        <h1>Service</h1>
        <p>Site design services are typically the lead component of a development proposal. These services set the stage for the development project by analyzing zoning, site features and setting. These parameters are necessary for laying out conceptual residential, commercial and other land uses before hard lining development proposals. When providing site design services the lead design professional frequently leads the approvals process through the local and SEQR review. Landscape plans supplement this effort as a component of the site engineering plans.
